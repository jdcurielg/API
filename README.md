## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code 

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `14.15.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the API 

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

4) Add in your MongoDB database:

   A database with the name "db"
   
5) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and start.
